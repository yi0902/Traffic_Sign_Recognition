# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
This is a project for Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree. 

Data used come from German Traffic Sign Dataset. Some additional fake data was generated, as well as 5 testing images data taken from google street view. To execute the notebook, you need to download data from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__BW8p2FXd2UUc2OHExV3l1S0E, and put them under a folder called traffic_data 

The objective is to build a deep learning network to classify nearly 40k traffic sign images to 43 classes.
